# Creating Java programs in Codio

## See Assign04_MarkovImitator.pdf for instructions

### Make a new file
Use **File > New File...** or right-click in the file tree to create a new file. You can right-click in the file tree to rename or delete files.

From the terminal, use **touch** followed by the name for a new file. A new, empty file will be created which you can then click on in the file tree to open in the editor. To create a java source code file, the filename must end with **.java** (*that's a period followed by the letters 'java'*).

### Compile & Run your program
To compile from the terminal prompt, use **javac** followed by the complete name of your source code file (*including '.java'*). To execute (run) your program, use **java** followed by the first part of the class file (*up to but not including the period*) containing the main method of your program.

There is also a *Compile & Run* menu available in the Codio window (opens a separate terminal window).

### Using the terminal
You can repeat a previous command by using the up arrow on your keyboard to 'go back' to the command you want to repeat. You can quickly enter a filename in the terminal by typing the first few letters, then pressing 'tab' on your keyboard. The **clear** command will refresh the terminal display.

### Reconfigure your Panels for easier development
Use the **View > Panels** menu on the top tool bar to segment your screen. For a side-by-side arrangement, use "View/Panels/Split Vertical". Then drag the tab of the file or terminal (the part with the name) you want to move into the new panel.

### Cut your development time by using keyboard shortcuts
Most of the codio menu commands are shown with keyboard equivalents according to whether you're using Windows or MacOS. Using the keyboard for the commands you use frequently can save time.# markovImitator
